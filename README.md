# Dash CSS

Design your project faster and better with a Dash

</div>

---

## Quick Start

To start using the components in your project, Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://dash-css.netlify.app/css/style.css">
```

Many of Posh UI components, like Modal, Toast, and others, require the use of JavaScript to function. For proper functioning of those, Copy-paste the following `<script>` near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them.

```html
    <script src="https://dash-css.netlify.app/css/app.js"></script>
```
